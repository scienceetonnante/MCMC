# Decipher using Markov Chain Monte Carlo

Code I created for my Youtube video :

I don't do any maintenance on it.

Run create_dictionnary.py once to create the dictionary.data file

Then run decipher_MCMC.py :
- set COUNT_BIGRAMS = True at least once to create the bigrams file (can then subsequently set to False)
- text to decipher should be in ciphered_text string (line 58)
